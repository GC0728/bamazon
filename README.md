Welcome to the Bamazon application! Bamazon is an application that allows its users to query a table of products. Information about the products that is available include the product's name, it's sale price and the amount of the product currently available for purchase. 

Bamazon queries a database that contains ten available products for purchase. The user is able to query this product using a simple interface. This interface can either be scrolled through each item or selected by entering a corresponding number from 1 to ten ("assets/images/itemId-select.png") and ("assets/images/itemId-select2.png").
